Innovative criptocurrency controlled by majority of users. This criptocurrency will be used to buy domains with our own DNS.

Everyone can propose creation of new exclusive domain extensions for AddressCoin.
Then, this is the ultimate system for decentralized domains!

## Wallet
* 3 currency balances: Emercoin, Namecoin and AddressCoin;
* Can exchange between 3 coins (using Bitcoin base value and AddressCoin if available);

## Core
* Fork from Emercoin (.emc, .coin, .lib, .bazar domains);
* Namecoin merged (.bit domains);
* Network.wd ownership;
* Users can remove/add new domains;
* Starter pack domains [#7](https://github.com/AddressCoin/AddressCoin/issues/7);
* Disccounts when register more than one domain with same name [#8](https://github.com/AddressCoin/AddressCoin/issues/8);
* .wd names can only be registered with majority users approval;
